# reflective-chain-of-thoughts
Reflective Chain Of Thoughts (RCoT) is an attempt to combine the iterativeness of the CoT prompt with the deeper level of reflection of the ToT.

This method involves a deep step-by-step analysis, where we consider various perspectives and decide the best way forward at each step. We continue this process until we reach a satisfactory conclusion. The overall goal is to think critically, analyze the problem, evaluate options, make decisions, and assess our progress regularly.

To summarize the steps:

0.CoT - Step-by-step Analysis: Begin thinking about the first step to approach the goal.

1.Starting  a new interaction: here we make a summary of all previous paths decided.

2.ToT - Expanding Thoughts: Consider different perspectives and potential paths related to this first step.

3.Deciding the Path: Decide the most promising path based on the different approaches.

4.Progress Check: Evaluate if the decision brings us closer to the goal.

5.Goal Achievement Check:  This step is to evaluate if the expected result has been achieved. If not, you continue refining and developing your ideas.

6.Loop Back: Based on the progress check, return to the CoT and repeat the process, adjusting as necessary.
