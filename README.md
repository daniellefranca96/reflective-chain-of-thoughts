# reflective-chain-of-thoughts
Reflective Chain Of Thoughts (RCoT) is an attempt to combine the iterativeness of the CoT prompt with the deeper level of reflection of the ToT.

This method involves a deep step-by-step analysis, where we consider various perspectives and decide the best way forward at each step. We continue this process until we reach a satisfactory conclusion. The overall goal is to think critically, analyze the problem, evaluate options, make decisions, and assess our progress regularly.

To summarize the steps:

CoT - Step-by-step Analysis: Begin thinking about the first step to approach the goal.
Starting  a new interaction: here we make a summary of all previous paths decided.
ToT - Expanding Thoughts: Consider different perspectives and potential paths related to this first step.
Deciding the Path: Decide the most promising path based on the different approaches.
Progress Check: Evaluate if the decision brings us closer to the goal.
Goal Achievement Check:  This step is to evaluate if the expected result has been achieved. If not, you continue refining and developing your ideas.
Loop Back: Based on the progress check, return to the CoT and repeat the process, adjusting as necessary.


## Running
The prompt file contains the first version of the method, it was tested on GPT3 and GPT4. To run it copy the template, fill your GOAL and EXPECTED RESULTS and run it in an LLM.

## Feedback & Contribution
Any feedback or contribution to improve the method are welcome.
